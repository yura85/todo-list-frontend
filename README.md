#Planning, Process and Problem-solving Strategy

In the beginning of my project planning i considered a number of options for my

wireframes and user stories. I design/look for my app and what would be the relevant

features of a todo list for a potential user. The latter would not be possible without

building a backend structure condusive to my client side. I concluded that my backend

would be built with Rails. Throughout the process of my work, I always considered my

options before moving onto the next stage of our build, whether it was a small CSS issue

or a larger question regarding our app functionality
